# Week 1

## Task Completed
I met with team members to discuss the scope of our project and plan the next steps. However, there was no client meeting during this week, which meant we couldn't finalize key project decisions or requirements. This delay impacted our ability to move forward with our projects.
Despite the lack of client input, we used this week to align internally, identify what could be the core features of the system. This allowed us to hit the ground running once we had feedback from the client.
